Recently, Ambokile (Adio) Uncle Cleve, eldest son was featured on Trini blog/magazine Frizzle Fowl, and this was not a brief mention either, the post goes in depth into the Adio's background, work, family life, etc. Congrats Adio, go give it a read heregit  {{ hlp.11ty.openUrl('https://frizzlefowl.wordpress.com/2021/06/30/meet-ambokile-adio-the-dedicated-father-exemplary-educator-and-award-winning-tanner/', 'Abido on Frizzle Fowl' ) | safe }}

> I first met the Adios while teaching at PFESS. I got to know their daughter Fana through a few co-curricular clubs in which I managed. With a genteel warmth and infectious giggle, Fana smile lit up any room, and she graciously conducted herself with a quiet self-awareness. She did not fall far from the tree, and when I met her mother, I was amazed at how similar these two were. Mrs. Adio was a great parent support; highly involved in school activities, and Mr. Adio would be the stalwart backgrounder and financier of some of our schoolâ€™s outreach projects.
