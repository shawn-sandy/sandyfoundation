Hi! I'm @zabocahontas, the avocado girl. Welcome to my shiny new blog where I geek out on topics like self care and vegan fitness! My wellness journey began in 2019 when I started pole dancing. I fell in love with the art of pole and I wanted to condition my mind and body to get better at it. Pole (or what I like to call 'yoga on a stick') pushed me to be stronger and more disciplined. I was not always fit or healthy. I was prediabetic, sedentary, lacked self-control, and addicted to unhealthy fast foods. Now, I am so much happier and I share my progress on YouTube.
