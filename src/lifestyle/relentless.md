Beyond the fences of the five senses\
where the empirical bows before the endless\
where the metaphysical drowns the common senseless\
is where the spiritual’s found and faith commences\
I misappropriate these senses as I apprehend the Endless\
using limited senses speaking of the Most High in tenses\
is like boxes and fences\
in fact all my evidence is\
like trying to fit a whole story in 2 sentences\
breaking supernatural law has consequences\
now is that what intelligence is\
then I wonder what spiritual negligence is\
Lord, help me to give up my defenses\
because before You I should be defenseless\
break down all of my pretenses\
remove my humanistic self-worshipping lenses\
so that I can see Your truth as Your love is—**relentles**s!\

Note: started @ work while thinking about how to describe faith from the vantage point of the otherwise cynical academician who could be tempted by agnosticism and humanistic intellectualism…myself… Actually two poems merged into one. The first 4 lines were written 6/7/05 and the rest somewhere around 9/22/08. Merged 2/14/09.
