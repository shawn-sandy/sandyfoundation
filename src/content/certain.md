 > Who am I? I am anthropology always searching for my beginning. I am professor, educator, student fashionista doctor, I am always instilled in credentials to my potential I doh sleep and ability. I am a lawyer, soldier poet. I am mental health therapy. I am intrapreneur adventurer I am spouses brought into the dentures of who I am.

  So when you dig me out of my deepest roots, it will show that love and marriage is part of the truth of who I am. I am I watch subtract going wild. I am an argument about scripture that last more than just a while I'm out walking the beat. I am leaving the chat if someone don't mute my notifications for goodness sake, who am I? I am humor after subsided emotions I'm an extended arm offering support despite different notions I still am. I am birthdays and anniversaries more than you can count.
