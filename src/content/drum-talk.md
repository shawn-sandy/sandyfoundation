“ I’m the drum. You’re the drum. We’re he drum. Where I come from, we say that rhythm is the
soul of life. The whole universe revolves in rhythm. When we get out of rhythm, that’s when get
into trouble. We are rhythm or we are not rhythm. The rhythm of life, the rhythm of
relationships. Because of its rhythmic nature, because it helps keep us in rhythm, the drum, next
to the human voice, is our most important, most sacred instrument.”
Babartunde Olatunji

The Beat of My Drum

On September 9, 1739, near the western branch of the Stono River in St Paul’s Parish, twenty
miles of Charleston. A core of twenty Angolans seized a store of firearms, marching off on a trail
of destruction, with drums, drawing more and more people. A militia was formed and a battle
resulted. Drums along with other loud instruments were banned as a result of the Stono
Rebellion, not only in the south but in the Caribbean as well. British authorities banned the use
for fear he islanders would use drums to organize and plot. Black folks continue to hold dances
at night in spite of the banning of drums by using other instruments.

Religious organizations assisted in efforts to control the the African elements of music. The
hymns and spiritual songs of Dr. Isaac Watts, published in various colonial editions was used as
a way of converting Africans trough more edifying examples of Western music. In many cases
the reverse of the intended effect took place. European idols were transformed and enriched by
the African tradition unto which they were grafted. The ability of African performance arts to
transform the European tradition of composition while some of its elements is perhaps the most
striking and powerful evolutionary force in the history of modern music. The genres of music
that bear the marks of this influence are legion. Let’s name a few: gospels, spirituals, soul, rap,
ragtime, jazz, blues, R&B, blues, rock, samba, reggae, funk, salsa, calypso and Broadway
musicals.

Without the use of drums, there’s no rhythm and movement. The human voice was the most
widely used substitute for drums. Call and response, work songs, and all types of vocality were
developed, with the voice replicating drum patterns and creating counterpoints, using standard
singing, chanting, as well as extended techniques. Sounds of work itself, such as chopping wood
or marching as well as foot stomping or hand clapping, provided a basic time signature over
which the polyrhythmic vocal sounds could improvise. Sometime imitating the the beats of many
drums in one line, these vocal elements filled the incremental spaces between each clap of the
hand or fall of the hammer, and played an important role in the preservation of African rhythmic
heritage. Dance is based on rhythmic patterns of music.

Pearl Primus, a native of Trinidad emerge in the 1940s, studied of Africa and created a repertory of African based movements.
Geoffrey Holder, another native of Trinidad was not only a dancer, singer, painter and
choreographer, photographer, actor, writer and costume designer. His known films are Live and
Let Die, the James Bond thriller, and was known as the purveyor of the soft drink 7- UP.
Trinidad was creative in replacing bamboo sticks for drums, called Tamboo Bamboo ( Tamboo
is derived from the French name for drums – Tambour) Tamboo Bamboo have been orchestrated
into parts, the Boom, Faule, Cutters, Chandlers. Booms are your bass, Foule or Fullers are
tenors. Cutters are sopranos and Chandlers are altos. Empty biscuit tins or cans, beaten with
sticks became a part of the Tamboo Bamboo orchestra, along with metals such as brake drums, spoons and garbage cans. Eventually, larger drums replaced the small biscuit cans. And so, the first note chromatic scale steel drums were developed.
