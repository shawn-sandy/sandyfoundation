### The Story of Us

In the early morning hours of  October 30th  2002, Esme Lionel Sandy  exhaled his final breath, leaving behind the great love of his life.  In September 20th 2006, his love, Pomelia too passed, closing the chapter of a love story that endured the test of time for a little over seventy-five years.

> Esme Lionel Sandy was the eldest of the three sons of Joseph Sandy and Rhoda Charles. They were of Tobagonian stock, hardworking people who migrated to their sister isle of Trinidad to make a better life for themselves. **The Sandys were the reputed descendants of the legendary African warrior who led the enslaved persons in the first recorded uprising in Tobago in 1790.**

Five generations removed from slavery, Esme was born.  He had a natural sense of style, intellect, good looks, strength, good sense, agility and good taste that made him aspire to be a tailor. But his aspiration was thwarted by the poverty common to many in the laboring class at that time.  His father, Joseph wept at his limited resources which prevented him from helping his son achieve his ambition.  He could only reflect on how his own ambition to become a teacher was balked for the lack of shoes. Esme at least had shoes. He also loved a fine young woman who, by the standards of the day, was out of his league. That woman was Pomelia Veronica Gederon.

Pomelia was the only daughter of a small proprietor named Eugene Lucien Joseph Gederon, the husband of Victoria Christiana Cudjoe. Not much is known of Eugene Gederon. He died intestate a few months after Pomelia’s sixth birthday, leaving his Kayak widow to fight to keep a tiny portion of his estate for the benefit of their young daughter…and fight she did.

Having now obtained the rights over three acres of land, Victoria had to make it a going concern. Her income from her work as a seamstress was small, but as the daughter of a poor laborer, she was not unfamiliar with hard manual work. Nevertheless, she needed all the help she could get.
Joseph Sandy and his three sons lived nearby. From time to time, Joseph would provide labor with the help of his sons. He also provided occasional advice, along with great conversations. Over time, Victoria and Joseph became an item. It was only a matter of time before Joseph moved closer with his sons. Victoria began to take notice of these handsome boys. She replaced their ragged clothes with skillfully sewn shirts and trousers, transforming their appearance – and perhaps - their confidence.

It was her influence that sparked Esme’s interest in the tailoring arts.  It was also, under her roof that Pomelia’s friendship ignited his love.  But, the relationship between Joseph and Victoria kept Esme’s feelings in check. Eventually when Joseph and Victoria parted, Esme began to hope.
Hope wavered when three other suitors - all of them with more to offer than a poor laborer - pressed for Pomelia’s hand. She became engaged to marry one of them and Esme withdrew to Point Fortin to work. Nevertheless, he remained alert for any news he could get of her. Not hearing of any further progress to the matrimonial altar, he began to make discreet inquiries. One day, he received a note from her that said, “Come home. I still love you.” He lost no time in doing as she asked.

Victoria Gederon took notice and approved. Shortly before she died on April 1st 1932, she asked Esme to take Pomelia as his wife and take care of her. The couple moved in together. In January 1933, the following year, they welcomed their first child, 1) Olla Theresa into the world. 2) Cleve Peter, followed in June 1935; 3) Dallis Rita was next, in 4) September 1936; and 5) Deanna Synthia in July 1938.

The couple were married on June 4th 1939, and added seven more children in quick succession: 6 Eusebius Arthur in December, 1940, 7 Louise Veronica Dorris in June 1942, 8 Atwell Matthew in September 1944, 9 Esmay Theodosia in May 1946, 10 Victoria Lyra in November 1947, 11 Attlee Eugene in March 1950, 12 Linda Eutrice in September 1951.

In spite of all the difficulties attendant on raising eleven children on laborers’ wages in a rural village in Colonial Trinidad, through the Great Depression, World War II, and the immediate post-war era, in a society experiencing the social and political upheavals of the labor movement, and the socio-cultural impact of the American presence, Esme and Pomelia kept a peaceful, happy, stable, loving and Christian home. Their love story begins the story of us.
