> The Sandy Foundation is seeking to uplift, inspire, and transform the lives of men, women, boys and girls.

Who like their own family may be descendants of slaves. Who were knocked down, but not destroyed; timid, but not intimidated;
disappointed, but not defeated; bruised, but not broken; persecuted, but preserved for such a time like this. Through a united effort the Sandy family has combined their varied resources as professionals from their multifaceted walks of life to build a foundation to reach out to those less fortunate, to make an indelible impact in society.
